## Campjam API üí°: Backend for Learning Management System

This is the backend for the Campjam application, a robust RESTful API built to power a comprehensive learning management system (LMS). It handles all data management, user authentication, and business logic for the platform.

### ‚ú® Features

The Campjam API provides a secure and efficient foundation for the LMS with the following key features:

- **User Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Secure user registration and login are implemented using **Passport** and **Bcrypt** for password hashing.
  - A **role-based access control (RBAC)** system using a `UserRole` enum ensures that access to resources is based on user roles (Admin, Instructor, Student).
  - **Custom decorators and guards** restrict data access to the resource owner, providing strong security.
  - An **API throttler** is in place to protect the server from misuse and excessive requests.

- **Data Management (CRUD)**:
  - The API offers full **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** functionality for managing courses, course content, user profiles, and submissions.
  - Data is stored in a **PostgreSQL** database.
  - **Prisma ORM** simplifies schema management and database interactions, ensuring a reliable and type-safe data layer.

- **System Architecture**:
  - The application follows a **clean architecture** with a clear separation of concerns, organized into distinct layers (Controller, Service, Repository).
  - A **response transformer interceptor** ensures all successful API responses have a consistent format and automatically excludes sensitive information like passwords.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Usage

To set up the Campjam backend locally, follow these steps:

Follow these steps to get the Revobank Backend up and running on your local machine.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/revou-fsse-feb25/final-project-be-rizaldi-r.git
cd final-project-be-rizaldi-r

```

### 2\. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project based on the `.env.example` file.

```
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/campjam"

JWT_SECRET="" # Use a strong, unique key
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=""

JWT_EXPIRATION_ACCESS="15m" # e.g., 1h, 7d, 30m
JWT_EXPIRATION_REFRESH="7d"

```

**Important:**

¬† \* Replace `user`, `password`, and `campjam` with your PostgreSQL credentials and desired database name.
¬† \* Generate a strong `JWT_SECRET` for production environments.

### 3\. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install

```

### 4\. Run Prisma Migrations

Apply the database schema and generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init # Use 'init' or a descriptive name for your first migration
npx prisma generate

```

If you make changes to your Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`), remember to run `npx prisma migrate dev` again to update your database.

# or
yarn start:dev
# or
pnpm run start:dev

```
